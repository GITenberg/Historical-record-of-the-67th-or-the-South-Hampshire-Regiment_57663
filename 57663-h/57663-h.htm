<h2 class="no-brk lsp2">PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class="r20" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
long a period, being undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under his Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General's Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore:" and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
our fellow citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar's favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar's legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were "<em>men-at-arms</em>," and sixty "<em>shot</em>;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral's regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
"grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
similar to those at present in use, were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral's
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years' War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years' war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates, in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
arms.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to insure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

<p>After its formation as a distinct regiment, the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>
remained at various stations in England during
the years 1759 and 1760. Its Colonel, James Wolfe, had
been appointed, in January, 1758, Brigadier-General in
North America, and afterwards distinguished himself in
the operations preceding the capture of <em>Cape Breton</em>,
which surrendered on the 26th of July, 1758, and again
in the expedition against <em>Quebec</em>, when he died of the
wounds received at the battle on the heights of Abraham,
above Quebec, on the 13th of September, 1759.</p>

<p>On the 24th of October, 1759, His Majesty was pleased
to confer the colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment
on Lieut.-Colonel Lord Frederick Cavendish, from the
First Foot Guards, in succession to Major-General James
Wolfe, deceased.</p>

<p>The decease of King George II. occurred on the 25th

<p>The expedition appeared before <em>Belle-Isle</em> on the 7th of
April, and a landing was attempted on the following day;
but the whole island appeared like one vast fortress;&mdash;the
little which nature had left undone by rocks and crags,
having been supplied by art; so that when the grenadiers
gained the shore, the enemy was discovered so strongly
fortified, that no efforts of the few men which could be
landed at once, were of any avail. A boat of Erskine's
grenadiers (<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>), commanded by Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Thomas Osborne, landed at a point, and drew up undiscovered.
His situation flanked the enemy, but no
other boat followed. The French immediately came out,
and Captain Osborne advanced to meet them. Twice
brought to the ground by a shot, he pressed on, and
approached so close to the enemy, that he exchanged
thrusts with the French officer in command. The English
fired, and then charged with the bayonet. The commanders
on both sides were killed, when the English,
being without leaders, were unable to maintain their
position.&mdash;Attempts to secure a landing on other points
of the island being also unsuccessful, orders were given to
desist from the attempt, and the men returned to the
boats, and proceeded back to their several ships. Many
of the boats were destroyed or damaged in this attempt,
and about five hundred men were lost in killed, wounded,
and missing.</p>

<p>Commodore Keppel stated in his letter, of the 13th of
April, 1761, to the Right Honorable Mr. Secretary Pitt,
afterwards created the Earl of Chatham, that</p>

<p>"One of the flat boats landed sixty of Erskine's
grenadiers (<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment), who got up a
very difficult place to the top of the hills, where they
formed with great skill, but were so immediately
routed by a much more numerous body of the enemy,
that all attempts to succour them were ineffectual, any
further than the boats bringing from the rocks about
twenty of them." On the 8th of April, 1761, the
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> had Captain Thomas Osborne and Lieutenant
John Gardner killed. Lieutenants Marmaduke
Green and William Herdsman were taken prisoners.
The other casualties were, two serjeants, one drummer, and
six rank and file killed; and sixteen rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>Major-General Hodgson subsequently received the following
reinforcements:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">and another attempt to effect a landing was resolved upon.
Brigadier-General Hamilton Lambert, on the 22nd of
April, 1761, effected a landing on the rocks near Point
Lomaria, where the difficulty of ascending the precipice
had made the enemy least attentive to that part. Beauclerk's
grenadiers (Nineteenth foot), with Captain Patterson
of that regiment, gained the summit before the
enemy saw what was intended, who immediately marched
a body of three hundred men to attack them; the grenadiers,
however, maintained their ground till the remainder
of Brigadier Lambert's troops arrived. The
success, thus gained, was promptly followed up; the
French were eventually repulsed, and three brass field-pieces,
with a few prisoners, were captured.</p>

<p>The cannon was afterwards landed from the ships and
dragged up the rocks; the lines which covered the
town of Palais were carried by assault, and the siege of
the citadel was prosecuted with vigour. The garrison
under their Governor, the Chevalier de St. Croix, made
a gallant defence, but on the 7th of June were forced
to surrender, and were permitted to march through the
breach with the honours of war in consideration of their
bravery. The capture of the island was thus achieved,
with the loss of about eighteen hundred men killed
and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 29th of May, 1761, Major-General Sir Henry
Erskine was removed to the Twenty-fifth regiment, and
King George III. was pleased to promote Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Hamilton Lambert, from the Thirty-first regiment, to the
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, as a reward for his gallantry at
the capture of Belle-Isle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>While success attended the arms of Great Britain, in
various parts of the world, the Sovereigns of France and
Spain were negotiating a compact, which gave a new
turn to the nature of the war; and the two crowns
attempted to coerce Portugal to unite in their designs
against Great Britain. Portugal at this period was
particularly weak; the capital, Lisbon, had been
destroyed by an earthquake five years previously, when
nearly thirty thousand inhabitants had been buried in its
ruins. This disaster had been followed by a conspiracy
against the life of the King, while the country was shaken
by internal commotions; at the same time the military
force of the kingdom was weak in numbers, scantily
furnished with arms, and without experienced officers.
Notwithstanding these adverse circumstances, the King of
Portugal resolved to adhere to his ancient alliance with
Great Britain; and in consequence of this decision,
France and Spain declared war against him. A powerful
Spanish army assembled on the frontiers, and threatened
to crush the Portuguese, when a military force, with
artillery, arms, stores, provisions, and money, was
furnished by Great Britain to assist its faithful ally; and
the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>, which had returned with the
expedition from the coast of France, was one of the
regiments selected for service in Portugal.</p>

<p>The regiment proceeded to Portugal, and continued in
that country until the termination of hostilities by the
treaty of Fontainebleau, the preliminary articles of which
were signed by the Duke of Bedford at Fontainebleau, on
the 3rd of November, 1762.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>Peace was proclaimed in London on the 22nd of March,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
1763, and by its provisions it was settled that the Island
of <em>Minorca</em>, which had been captured by the French in
April, 1756, should be restored to Great Britain. The
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> and the Third foot from Portugal,
the Eleventh, Thirty-third, and Thirty-seventh regiments
from Germany, and the Fifty-seventh from Gibraltar,
were embarked in order to form the garrison of
Minorca.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1768<br />1771</div>

<p>In the Royal Warrant of King George III. dated 19th of
December, 1768, containing regulations for the colours,
clothing, &amp;c. of the regiments of foot, it was directed that the
regimental colour of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment should
be <em>pale yellow</em>, being similar to the colours of the Twentieth
regiment, from which it was formed. The <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>
remained on duty at Minorca until July, 1771, when the
Third, Eleventh, and <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiments embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
for England, on being relieved by the Royals (second
battalion), the Fifty-first and Sixty-first regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1773</div>

<p>In the year 1773 the regiment proceeded to Scotland,
where it remained until the year 1775.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1774</div>

<p>On the decease of Lieut.-General Hamilton Lambert
in 1774, His Majesty was pleased to promote Lieut.-Colonel
Edward Maxwell Brown, from the Twenty-first,
Royal North British Fusiliers, to the colonelcy of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, on the 11th of March, 1774.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>The regiment embarked for Ireland in 1775, to replace
the Forty-second, Royal Highland regiment, and continued
on duty in that country until the year 1785.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>On the 31st of August, 1782, His Majesty directed that
the regiment should be designated the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>,
or the <span class="smcap">South Hampshire</span> regiment, with a view that a
connexion might be cultivated between the corps and that
county, in order to promote the success of the recruiting
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1785</div>

<p>Early in the year 1785 the regiment embarked from
Ireland for the West Indies, to relieve the Fifty-fifth
regiment.</p>

<p>The regiment proceeded from Barbadoes to Antigua
in the autumn of 1785.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1788</div>

<p>During the years 1788, 1789, 1790, 1791, and 1792,
the regiment was stationed at Grenada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>In the year 1793 the regiment was stationed at
Barbadoes, and in July, 1794, returned to Great Britain:
the regiment subsequently proceeded to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>On the 25th of February, 1796, the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>
regiment embarked from Ireland for the island of St.
Domingo. An expedition had proceeded to St. Domingo
in 1794, in order to aid the planters against the persecution
of the negro inhabitants, who had imbibed the doctrines
of liberty and equality, propagated at that period. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
distracted state of France afforded the inhabitants no
prospect of relief, and they were therefore desirous of
placing themselves under the protection of Great Britain.
Much resistance was experienced from the negroes, and
the English took possession of Port-au-Prince, the capital
of St. Domingo, now the republic of Hayti; but no
effectual steps could be taken for the reduction of the
island, as the yellow fever destroyed the Europeans with
frightful rapidity on their arrival on its fatal coast: the
British evacuated the place in 1798.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1798 the regiment proceeded
from St. Domingo to Jamaica, after having
suffered severely by disease at the former island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>On the 21st of October, 1801, the regiment embarked at
Jamaica for England, greatly reduced in numbers from
the effects of the climate of the West Indies.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1802</div>

<p>During the year 1802, the regiment was stationed in
South Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>On the 25th February, 1803, His Majesty was pleased
to appoint Lieut.-General Francis D'Oyly, from Colonel
Commandant of the Fifteenth foot, to the colonelcy of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, on the decease of General
Edward Maxwell Brown; and on the 9th of March following
General Peter Craig was appointed Colonel of the
regiment, in succession to Lieut.-General D'Oyly, whose
decease occurred on the 4th of March, 1803.</p>

<p>In consequence of the renewal of war with France,
and the extensive preparations made in the ports of that
country, particularly at Dunkirk and Boulogne, for
carrying into effect the threatened invasion of Great
Britain, the most active measures were adopted by the
British Government to frustrate the designs of the French
ruler. An Act of Parliament was passed in 1803 for
raising men for limited service in Great Britain and
Ireland, which was termed the <em>Army of Reserve Act</em>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the men so raised were formed into additional and distinct
battalions.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, which had embarked
for Ireland in the beginning of 1803, was authorised to
receive men raised in Ireland under the Army of Reserve
Act, and a <em>Second Battalion</em> was added to the establishment
on the 9th of July, 1803.</p>

<p>On the 13th of October the first battalion embarked
at Dundalk for Guernsey, where it arrived on the 25th
of November following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>About the middle of November, 1804, the regiment
was removed from the island of Guernsey to Portsmouth,
where it arrived on the 30th of November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>On the 25th of March, 1805, the regiment was augmented
to an establishment of 64 serjeants, 22 drummers,
and 1200 rank and file.</p>

<p>From Portsmouth the first battalion embarked on the
22nd of April, 1805, for the East Indies, and arrived in
the Presidency of Bengal on the 15th of September of
the same year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>In December, 1807, the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> proceeded
from Fort William to Dinapore, at which station the
regiment arrived in March following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>The regiment marched for Benares, in January, 1810,
and from thence to Ghazeepore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>In January, 1811, the regiment again proceeded to
Benares, and returned to Ghazeepore in the month of
February of that year.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir William Keppel, G.C.B., Colonel
Commandant of the Sixtieth, was appointed by His Majesty
Colonel of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, on the 7th
of February, 1811, on the decease of General Peter Craig.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1813</div>

<p>The regiment proceeded from Ghazeepore to Cawnpore
in January, 1813.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>On the 10th of October, 1815, the regiment marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
from Cawnpore to Meerut, where it arrived on the 7th
of November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment
marched from Meerut on the 15th of October, 1817, on
field service, and joined the army of reserve under the
command of Major-General Sir David Ochterlony. On
the 27th of November, the first battalion marched from
Rewarree, with the reserve of the grand army, to Jeypoor,
a city which derives its name from its founder Sevai Jye
Singh, a celebrated Hindoo warrior and statesman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>The battalion marched from Dungurter to Oojein in
the middle of February, where it joined the Bombay
division of the army, under Major-General Sir William
Grant Keir, on the 7th of March. It proceeded from
Oojein for Baroda on the 13th of March; and on the
9th of April following, marched from Baroda to Tankaira,
being the first regiment of His Majesty's army that crossed
the Peninsula of India. It embarked for Bombay, where
the battalion arrived on the 23rd of April.</p>

<p>On the 30th of April, 1818, six companies embarked
from Bombay for the southern Concan,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and were
present at the siege and surrender of the strong fortress of
<em>Ryghur</em> on the 10th of May following. This important
stronghold is situated upon the Ghauts which bound the
eastern frontier of the Concan, in a line between Poonah
and Bancoote, and was one of the fortresses which the
Peishwah, Bajee Rao, had surrendered on the 8th of May,
1817, as a pledge of his sincerity. Notwithstanding
the stupendous height and extensive area on the top
of the fortress, shells were thrown into every part of it,
and the palace set on fire, which greatly tended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
determine the enemy to surrender. The garrison held
out a flag for terms, and after three days of communication
and treaty, Lieut.-Colonel David Prother, C.B., of the
Ninth Native Infantry, was induced to allow the garrison
honorable terms, permitting them to march out with their
arms and private property, on the 10th of May. The wife
of His Highness the late Peishwah was found in the fort
on taking possession, and public property, in specie, to
the amount of five lacs.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Prother stated in Brigade Orders on
the 12th of May&mdash;</p>

<p>"The surrender of the fortress of Ryghur having closed
the operations, the Commanding Officer has peculiar
pleasure in offering a public acknowledgment to the
merits of those by whom this event has been so much
accelerated....</p>

<p>"Although Major Benjafield and the detachment of
His Majesty's <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, did not arrive
until nearly the end of the siege, yet the share taken by
them fully deserves the Commanding Officer's thanks."</p>

<p>The six companies of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment
returned to head-quarters on the 26th of May.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May, four companies embarked from
Bombay for Surat, and were present on the 8th, 18th,
21st, and 28th of June, when possession was taken of the
towns and forts of Nunderbar, Cokermundaye, Toulodah,
and Kopriel.</p>

<p>In the middle of September the first battalion embarked
in three divisions for the Deccan, and arrived at
Seroor on the 5th of October following; on the 30th
of October the regiment marched from Seroor, and
arrived at Mallygaum, the head-quarters of the troops in
Candeish, on the 11th of November. Colonel Huskinson,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>, being the senior officer, assumed
the command of the troops.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, in the name
and on the behalf of His Majesty, was pleased, on the
24th of October, 1818, to appoint Lieut.-Colonel John
Frederick Ewart, of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, to
which he had exchanged from half-pay of the Fifth West
India regiment, on the 5th of February, 1818, a Companion
of the most Honorable Military Order of the Bath.</p>

<p>The force commanded by Colonel S. Huskinson, of
which the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> formed part, marched on the
25th of November for the attack of the towns and forts of
<em>Amulneir</em> and <em>Behauderpore</em>, which surrendered at discretion
on the 30th of November and the 1st of December, and
of which possession was taken, the first place by the flank
companies of the regiment, and the latter by the auxiliary
horse under Captain Swanton.</p>

<p>Colonel Huskinson, commanding the troops at Candeish,
in his despatch to the Resident, the Honorable Mountstuart
Elphinstone, dated Camp before Amulneir, 30th
of November, 1818, stated,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It gives me the greatest satisfaction to have to
announce to you, for the information of the Most Noble
the Governor-General in India, that the fort of Amulneir
surrendered unconditionally to the force I have the
honor to command, about noon this day, where, as soon
after as possible, Brevet Major Owen, of His Majesty's
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, by my orders, occupied the
whole of the gates and fort with part of the flank
companies of that regiment. This service, I am happy
to say, was effected without firing a shot. May I
request your orders respecting the disposal of Ally
Jemadar and his followers, who are now prisoners in
camp."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the four companies, which left head-quarters in
May, rejoined the regiment.</p>

<p>Leaving Amulneir on the 4th of December, the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>
proceeded to Malligaum, where the battalion
arrived on the 14th of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> marched for Amulneir, with the
force under the command of Colonel Huskinson, on the
25th of February, 1819. On the 3rd of March eight
companies of the regiment, under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
Maxwell,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> proceeded to Asseerghur, and joined the force
under Brigadier-General Doveton, before the fortress of
<em>Asseerghur</em>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which, on account of its strength, has been
designated the "Gibraltar of the East."</p>

<p>The fortress of Asseerghur, which had been held by
one of Scindiah's refractory chiefs, is situated on a detached
hill between the rivers Nerbudda and Tapty: it consists
of an upper and lower fort; the upper one is of an
irregular form, about 1100 yards from east to west, and
about 600 from north to south; it crowns the top of the
hill, which is about 750 feet in height; a perpendicular
precipice from 80 to 120 feet, surmounted with a low
wall full of loopholes, surrounds it, with the exception of
one place, which is strongly fortified. Below are two
lines of works, the outer one forming the lower fort,
which rises directly above the Pettah,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and the entrance
to which is protected by strong gateways and flanking
works. Immense labour and great skill had been employed
to render this naturally strong post almost impregnable;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>and at the siege of which the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>
regiment was present.</p>

<p>The Hyderabad division was encamped at Neembolah,
about seven miles from Asseerghur, and negotiations
having failed, about twelve o'clock on the night of the
17th of March five companies of the Royal Scots (First
regiment of foot) with the flank companies of the Thirtieth,
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>, and Madras European regiment, five
companies of native infantry, and a detachment of sappers
and miners, the whole commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Fraser, of the Royal Scots, and a reserve commanded by
Major Dalrymple, of the Thirtieth, assembled at the camp
for the attack of the pettah of Asseer; another party was
also directed to co-operate in this service from Brigadier-General
Sir John Malcolm's division.</p>

<p>The column commenced its march between one and
two o'clock, advancing up the bed of a deep nullah, or
small river, nearly dry at the time; the assaulting party
arrived unobserved within five hundred yards of the pettah,
then rushed upon the gate with the greatest ardour
and steadiness, the Royal Scots leading the way. The
enemy was surprised, and, after discharging a few rounds
of grape, retired. The head of the attacking column forced
the gate, and proceeding up the main street, encountered
an advanced piquet of the enemy, which retired to the
lower fort, firing occasionally at the head of the column.
Major Charles MacLeod, of the East India Company's
service, Deputy-Quartermaster-General, acted as guide
on the occasion; by his direction the leading files of the
Royal Scots pursued the enemy close under the walls of
the fortress, from whence an incessant fire of artillery and
matchlocks was kept up; a few ill-directed rockets were
also discharged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The leading sections of the Royal Scots, which had
pursued the enemy up the hill, were joined by one or two
files of the Thirtieth and <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiments, the
whole amounting to about 25 or 30 men. As soon as
the enemy saw the small force before which he had
so precipitately fled, he immediately rallied, and came
shouting down the hill with augmented numbers to attack
this small party, but was repulsed by a spirited charge
with the bayonet, which, with a few rounds of musketry,
obliged him to retreat within the works, some of which
were within about fifty yards of this handful of men, leaving
the Chief, who was shot in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">melée</i>, and several men on
the field.</p>

<p>The pettah of Asseerghur was thus captured on the
morning of the 18th of March, with trifling loss; but on
the evening of the following day a desperate sally was
made by a part of the garrison on the advanced post of
the troops in the pettah, on which occasion Lieutenant-Colonel
Fraser, of the Royal Scots, was unfortunately
killed, while gallantly rallying the party under his command,
and keeping the advance in their position. The
enemy was, however, immediately driven back, and compelled
to retire into the fort.</p>

<p>During the progress of constructing new batteries on
elevated and commanding situations, the dragging of
ordnance into many of them was performed by the
European soldiers, who literally worked like horses; during
the whole of the time they were annoyed by a constant fire
of matchlocks from the walls of the upper fort (the lower
fort had been taken possession of on the 30th of March,
by part of Brigadier-General Sir John Malcolm's division),
but which was too distant to prevent the execution
of this Herculean labour, which was performed with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
ardour and cheerfulness so characteristic of British
soldiers, when necessity demands from them any extraordinary
exertions.</p>

<p>On the 31st of March, part of the Bengal army, consisting
of 2200 native troops, with 22 pieces of heavy
ordnance, commanded by Brigadier-General Watson,
joined the besieging force; and these guns were soon
placed in battery, and opened on the fort. The storm of
war now raged furiously round Asseerghur, and a breach
was soon effected in the outer wall at the only assailable
part of the fort; at the same time two batteries were
directed against the inner wall. This unremitting fire
was continued until the 6th of April, when the garrison
forced the Killedar to sue for terms, namely, "liberty
to preserve their arms, and to depart with their personal
property."</p>

<p>These conditions were refused, and hostilities recommenced;
the Killedar, however, accepted the terms
offered on the 8th, and agreed to surrender the fort on
the morning of the 9th, when the firing ceased; but as he
stated that he could not answer for the garrison, the
control of which he had lost, preparations were made for
renewing operations in case of refusal.</p>

<p>The garrison surrendered unconditionally on the 9th of
April, and five hundred men of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>,
under the command of Major Benjafield, with the 7th
Madras light cavalry, and the second battalion of the 13th
Madras native infantry, took possession of the fortress, on
the garrison marching out and laying down their arms on
the public parade.</p>

<p>The following was the return of ordnance, &amp;c. taken
in the fortress of Asseerghur by the troops under the
command of Brigadier-General Doveton. Brass and
iron ordnance, 128; about 36,000 stone and iron shot, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
different sizes; two hundredweight of gunpowder; 2000
wall-pieces, of different sizes; and about four hundredweight
of grape-shot.</p>

<p>During the siege the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> had Lieutenants
J. Adair and John Hannah severely wounded; Lieutenant
Adair<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was twice severely wounded by matchlock
balls in the left arm and right side, on the 19th of March,
in repulsing the sortie of the garrison of Asseerghur:&mdash;one
serjeant, one drummer, and eleven rank and file
were wounded.</p>

<p>Major Owen, who commanded the flank companies of
His Majesty's <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, was particularly
mentioned in Orders by Brigadier-General Doveton, who
also reported that "the fall of Asseer leaves to the
Brigadier-General only the pleasing task of recording his
sense of the merits and exertions of the officers and troops,
and of bringing them to the notice of superior authority,
where they can alone be fully and properly appreciated.</p>

<p>"To the means placed at the Brigadier-General's
disposal, by the rapid advance of the division under the
personal command of Brigadier-General Sir John
Malcolm, K.C.B., as well as of the troops from the
Nerbudda field force and from Saugur, under the
personal command of Brigadier-General Watson, C.B.,
to the science and skill of the engineer and artillery
branches, and finally to the distinguished gallantry and
persevering exertions of the whole of the officers and
troops whom the Brigadier-General has the honor to
command, are principally to be attributed the fall of so
stupendous a fortress in eleven days from the opening
of the trenches....</p>

<p>"He requests also that Lieutenant-Colonels MacDowell,
Dewar, Ewart (Lieut.-Colonel of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></span>
regiment), Greenstreet, and Pollock, commanding
brigades of infantry, will be fully persuaded
of the high estimation in which he holds the eminent
services rendered by them, as well as by the officers
and men of their several brigades"....</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Sir John Malcolm also reported:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have to state my sense of the zeal and activity of
my Aide-de-Camp, Ensign G. Pasley, of His Majesty's
Fourteenth foot, and extra Aide-de-Camp Lieutenant
J. Pasley, of His Majesty's <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> foot."</p>

Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council
assembled, waited on His Majesty, and the Recorder, Sir William
Moreton, spoke the following address, referring to the capture of
<em>Belle-Isle</em>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>To the King's <em>most excellent</em> Majesty. <em>The humble Address of the
Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London, in
Common Council assembled.</em></p></div>

<p class="noindent">Most Gracious Sovereign,</p>

<p>
With reverential awe and gratitude to the Supreme Giver of all
victory, we, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the
Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of your City of London, in
Common Council assembled, humbly approach your Royal Presence,
to express our joy and exultation on the entire reduction of the important
island of <em>Belle-Isle</em>, by the conduct, intrepidity, and perseverance
of your Majesty's land and naval forces:&mdash;a conquest
which, after more than one fruitless attempt in former times, seems
to have been reserved by Divine Providence to grace the auspicious
beginning of your Majesty's reign, and confirms our hopes of a long
continuance of wise, steady, and successful measures.
</p>
<p>
A blow so humiliating to the pride and power of France, cannot
but impress that haughty nation with a due sense of the superiority
of a Patriot King ruling over a free, brave, and united people, and
will, we trust, convince them of the danger of delaying to accept
such terms of peace as Your Majesty's equity, wisdom, and moderation
shall think fit to prescribe.
</p>
<p>
What therefore have we more to wish, but that Your Majesty
may long, very long, continue the guardian and protector of the
religious, civil, and commercial rights of Great Britain and her
Colonies; and that Your Majesty's wisdom may ever be seconded
by equally faithful and spirited councils; and your commands
executed with no less ardour, emulation, and success.
</p>
<p>
On our part, permit us humbly to assure Your Majesty, that
your faithful citizens of London will, with unwearied zeal and cheerfulness,
contribute to support a vigorous prosecution of this just and
necessary war; until Your Majesty, having sufficiently vindicated the
honor of your Crown, and secured the trade, navigation, and possessions
of your subjects, shall enjoy the blessing and the glory of
giving repose to Europe, of wholly attending to and promoting the
virtue and happiness of your people, and of cultivating all the softer
arts of peace.

September, 1708, Minorca was taken by Admiral Leake and a land
force under Lieut.-General Stanhope, after a siege of about three
weeks. The island was ceded to Great Britain by the treaty of
Utrecht, and remained in its possession until 1756, when, in April of
that year, it was besieged by the French, under Marshal the Duke
de Richelieu. After a brave defence by the Governor, General
Blakeney, the garrison surrendered, and in consideration of their
gallantry were permitted to march out with all the honours of war.
At the peace of Fontainebleau, in 1763, Minorca was restored to the
English in exchange for Belle-Isle. In February, 1782, the garrison,
under the Governor, Lieut.-General the Honorable James
Murray, after suffering severely from sickness, surrendered to the
Duke de Crillon, the Commander-in-Chief of the combined French
and Spanish forces, and Minorca was retained by Spain by the
treaty of peace of 1783. Minorca again surrendered to a British
force under General the Honorable Charles Stuart, on the 15th of
November, 1798; and at the peace of Amiens, in 1802, Minorca
was restored to the Spaniards, under whose sway it remains at the
present period.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p class="noindent">Europe gained a short cessation from hostilities by the
Treaty of Amiens, and the interval of peace was employed
by Napoleon Bonaparte in furthering his views for the
aggrandizement of France, to enable him to become the
dictator of Europe. The British Government and people,
suspicious of Napoleon's projects, and roused to active
measures by the threat of invasion, were enthusiastic in
devising means to frustrate his designs, and the "<em>Army
of Reserve Act</em>" was passed, for raising men for home
service by ballot, while numerous volunteer and yeomanry
corps were formed in every part of the kingdom.</p>

<p>To these circumstances the <span class="smcap">Second Battalion</span> of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment owes its origin, and the battalion
was formed of men raised in Ireland, for limited
service under the provisions of the "Army of Reserve
Act," which was passed in June, 1803; the battalion
was placed on the establishment from the 9th of July
following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>The <em>Second Battalion</em> was also authorised to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
men raised in Ireland, for limited service, under the
"<em>Additional Force Act</em>," which was passed on the 14th of
July, 1804.</p>

<p>The battalion was stationed in Ireland until the 20th
of January, 1804, when it embarked at Warren's Point,
and arrived at Greenock on the 23rd of the same month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>On the 29th of February, 1804, the battalion proceeded
to Guernsey, where it remained until the 17th of
November, 1807, when it was removed to Alderney.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1810</div>

<p>From Alderney the battalion returned to Guernsey in
July, 1810.</p>

<p>Six companies of the battalion, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel William Prevost, embarked for
Gibraltar on the 29th of July, 1810, at which station
they arrived on the 24th of September.</p>

<p>The four companies left at Guernsey, embarked for
England in August, 1810, where they continued to be
stationed during the remainder of that year.</p>

<p>The six companies of the second battalion remained at
Gibraltar until the 22nd of November, 1810, when they
embarked for Cadiz, to join the army under the command
of Lieutenant-General Thomas Graham, afterwards Lord
Lynedoch.</p>

<p>The six companies arrived at Cadiz on the 9th of
December, 1810, which was at that period besieged by
a powerful French army, under Marshal Soult, who
subsequently proceeded on an expedition into Estremadura,
leaving Marshal Victor to blockade Cadiz.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> remained at Cadiz until the 18th
of February, 1811, when they proceeded with the army
under the command of Lieutenant-General Thomas
Graham, which consisted of a British force of about three
thousand, and a body of seven thousand troops commanded
by General La Pena. The design of the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was to make a combined attack on the rear of the
French army blockading Cadiz. The forces disembarked
at Algesiras on the 23rd of February, and being
all united at Tarifa, marched from thence on the 28th of
February.</p>

<p>General Zayas pushed a strong body of Spanish troops
across the river Santi Petri, near the coast, on the 1st of
March, threw a bridge over, and formed a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-de-pont</i>.
This post was attacked by the enemy on the nights of the
3rd and 4th of March, who was repulsed, though the
Spaniards sustained considerable loss.</p>

<p>On the 5th of March, 1811, Lieutenant-General
Graham and the army under his command arrived on
the low ridge of <em>Barrosa</em>, where a brilliant victory was
gained over the French army under Marshal Victor, composed
of the two divisions of Generals Rufin and Laval.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Graham in his despatch to the
Earl of Liverpool, dated Isla de Leon, March 6th, 1811,
stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The circumstances were such as compelled me to
attack this very superior force. In order as well to
explain to your Lordship the circumstances of peculiar
disadvantage under which the action was begun, as to
justify myself from the imputation of rashness in the
attempt, I must state to your Lordship, that the allied
army, after a night march of sixteen hours from the
camp near Veger, arrived, on the morning of the 5th, at
the low ridge of Barrosa, about four miles to the southward
of the mouth of the Santi Petri river. This
height extends inland about a mile and a half, continuing
on the north the extensive heathy plain of
Chiclana. A great pine forest skirts the plain, and
circles round the height at some distance, terminating
down to Santi Petri; the intermediate space between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the north side of the height and the forest being uneven
and broken.</p>

<p>"A well-conducted and successful attack on the rear
of the enemy's lines near Santi Petri, by the vanguard
of the Spanish army, under Brigadier-General Ladrizabel,
having opened the communication with the Isla
de Leon, I received General La Pena's directions to
move down from the position of Barrosa to that of the
Torre de Bermesa, about half-way to the Santi Petri
river, in order to secure the communication across the
river, over which a bridge had been lately established.
This latter position occupies a narrow woody ridge, the
right on the sea cliff, the left falling down to the
Almanza creek on the edge of the marsh. A hard
sandy beach gives an easy communication between the
western points of these two positions.</p>

<p>"My division, being halted on the eastern slope of the
Barrosa height, was marched about twelve o'clock
through the wood towards the Bermesa, cavalry patrols
having previously been sent towards Chiclana, without
meeting with the enemy. On the march I received
notice that the enemy had appeared in force on the
plain, and was advancing towards the heights of Barrosa.</p>

<p>"As I considered that position as the key of that of
Santi Petri, I immediately countermarched in order to
support the troops left for its defence, and the alacrity
with which this manœuvre was executed, served as a
favourable omen. It was, however, impossible in such
intricate and difficult ground to preserve order in the
columns, and there never was time to restore it entirely.</p>

<p>"But before we could get ourselves quite disentangled
from the wood, the troops on the Barrosa Hill were
seen returning from it, while the enemy's left wing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
rapidly ascending. At the same time his right wing
stood on the plain, on the edge of the wood, within
cannon-shot. A retreat in the face of such an enemy,
already within reach of the easy communication by
the sea-beach, must have involved the whole allied
army in all the danger of being attacked during the
unavoidable confusion of the different corps arriving on
the narrow ridge of Bermesa nearly at the same time.</p>

<p>"Trusting to the known heroism of British troops,
regardless of the numbers and position of their enemy,
an immediate attack was determined on. Major
Duncan soon opened a powerful battery of ten guns in
the centre. Brigadier-General Dilkes with the brigade
of Guards, Lieut.-Colonel Browne's (of the Twenty-eighth)
flank battalion, Lieut.-Colonel Norcott's two
companies of the second Rifle corps, and Major Acheson
with a part of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> foot (separated
from the regiment in the wood) formed on the right.</p>

<p>"Colonel Wheatly's brigade, with three companies of
the Coldstream Guards, under Lieut.-Colonel Jackson
(separated likewise from his battalion in the wood) and
Lieut.-Colonel Barnard's flank battalion, formed on
the left.</p>

<p>"As soon as the infantry was thus hastily got together,
the guns advanced to a more favourable position,
and kept up a most destructive fire.</p>

<p>"The right wing proceeded to the attack of General
Rufin's division on the hill, while Lieut.-Colonel
Barnard's battalion, and Lieut.-Colonel Bushe's
detachment of the twentieth Portuguese, were warmly
engaged with the enemy's tirailleurs on our left.</p>

<p>"General Laval's division, notwithstanding the havoc
made by Major Duncan's battery, continued to advance
in very imposing masses, opening his fire of musketry,
and was only checked by that of the left wing. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
left wing now advanced firing; a most determined charge
by the three companies of Guards and the eighty-seventh
regiment, supported by all the remainder of the wing,
decided the defeat of General Laval's division.</p>

<p>"The eagle of the eighth regiment of light infantry,
which suffered immensely, and a howitzer, rewarded
this charge, and remained in possession of Major
Gough,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of the Eighty-seventh regiment. These attacks
were zealously supported by Colonel Belson with the
Twenty-eighth regiment and Lieut.-Colonel Prevost
with a part of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>.</p>

<p>"A Reserve formed beyond the narrow valley, across
which the enemy was closely pursued, next shared the
same fate, and was routed by the same means.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the right wing was not less successful;
the enemy, confident of success, met General Dilkes
on the ascent of the hill, and the contest was sanguinary:
but the undaunted perseverance of the brigade of
Guards, of Lieut.-Colonel Browne's battalion, and of
Lieut.-Colonel Norcott's, and Major Acheson's detachment,
overcame every obstacle, and General Rufin's
division was driven from the heights in confusion, leaving
two pieces of cannon.</p>

<p>"No expressions of mine could do justice to the conduct
of the troops throughout. Nothing less than the almost
unparalleled exertions of every officer, the invincible
bravery of every soldier, and the most determined
devotion to the honor of His Majesty's arms, in all,
could have achieved this brilliant success, against such
a formidable enemy so posted.</p>

<p>"In less than an hour and a half from the commencement
of the action, the enemy was in full retreat.
The retiring division met, halted, and seemed inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to form; a new and more advanced position of our
artillery quickly dispersed them.</p>

<p>"The exhausted state of the troops made pursuit
impossible. A position was taken on the eastern side
of the hill; and we were strengthened on our right
by the return of the two Spanish battalions that had
been attached before to my division, but which I had
left on the hill, and which had been ordered to retire.
These battalions (Walloon Guards and Ciudad Real)
made every effort to come back in time, when it was
known that we were engaged....</p>

<p>"When all have so distinguished themselves, it is
scarcely possible to discriminate any as the most
deserving of praise. Your Lordship will, however,
observe how gloriously the brigade of Guards under
Brigadier-General Dilkes, with the commanders of the
battalions, Lieut.-Colonel the Honorable C. Onslow
and Lieut.-Colonel Sebright (wounded), as well as
the three separated companies under Lieut.-Colonel
Jackson, maintained the high character of His Majesty's
household troops. Lieut.-Colonel Browne, with his
flank battalion, Lieut.-Colonel Norcott, and Major
Acheson deserve equal praise.</p>

<p>"I must equally recommend to your Lordship's notice,
Colonel Wheatly, with Colonel Belson, Lieut.-Colonel
Prevost, and Major Gough, and the officers of the
respective corps composing his brigade....</p>

<p>"The assistance I received from the unwearied exertions
of Lieut.-Colonel Macdonald,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and the officers
of the Adjutant-General's department, of Lieut.-Colonel
the Honorable C. Cathcart, and the officers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the Quartermaster-General's Department, of Captain
Birch and Captain Nicholas, and the officers of the
Royal Engineers, of Captain Hope, and the officers of
my Personal Staff, (all animating by their example,)
will ever be most gratefully remembered....</p>

<p>"I cannot conclude this despatch without earnestly
recommending to His Majesty's gracious notice for promotion,
Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Browne, Major of the 28th
foot, Brevet Lieut.-Colonel Norcott, Major of the 95th
Rifle Regiment, Major Duncan, Royal Artillery, Major
Gough of the 87th, Major the Honorable E. Acheson of
the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>, and Captain Birch of the Royal
Engineers, all in the command of corps or detachments on
this memorable service; and I confidently trust that the
bearer of this despatch, Captain Hope, (to whom I refer
your Lordship for further details,) will be promoted, on
being permitted to lay the Eagle at His Majesty's feet."</p>

<p>Such are the details of the battle of <em>Barrosa</em>, in which
the enemy lost about three thousand men in killed,
wounded, and prisoners, while that of the English amounted
to 1243 killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> had Lieut.-Colonel Prevost,
Captain Patrickson, Lieutenant W. Ronald, and Ensign
Sutherland wounded; ten men of the regiment were
killed; and one serjeant and thirty rank and file were
wounded.</p>

<p>The British captured an Eagle, six pieces of cannon,
and among the prisoners were the General of Division
Rufin, the General of Brigade Rosseau; the Chief of the
Staff, General Bellegrade; an Aide-de-Camp of Marshal
Victor, the Colonel of the eighth regiment, and several
other officers. The prisoners amounted to two General
Officers, one field-officer, nine captains, eight subalterns,
and 420 rank and file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Both Houses of Parliament unanimously voted their
thanks to Lieut.-General Graham, and the officers and
men under his command, for this victory, and their valour
and ability were highly applauded by the nation. On the
11th of November following, His Majesty's commands
were communicated in the subjoined memorandum:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><em>Horse Guards, November 11th, 1811.</em></p>

<p class="fs70 pad2">MEMORANDUM.</p>

<p>The Prince Regent having been graciously pleased, in
the name and on the behalf of His Majesty, to command
that, in commemoration of the brilliant victory obtained
over the enemy by a division of His Majesty's army
under the command of Lieut.-General Thomas Graham,
at Barrosa, on the 5th of March, 1811, the undermentioned
officers of the army, present upon that occasion, should
enjoy the privilege of bearing a Medal, and His Royal
Highness having approved of the medal which has been

<p>Major the Honorable Edward Acheson, of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>
regiment, was promoted to the brevet rank
of Lieut.-Colonel in the army on the 30th March, 1811,
for his gallantry at Barrosa, as particularly noticed in
Lieut.-General Graham's despatch.</p>

<p>On the 26th May, 1817, the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment
received the Royal Authority to bear the word "<em>Barrosa</em>"
on the regimental colour and appointments, to commemorate
the gallantry of the second battalion on that occasion.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Graham, after this conflict, remained
some hours at the Barrosa heights, without being able to
procure any supplies for the exhausted troops, in consequence
of the commissariat mules having been dispersed
on the enemy's first attack of the hill. Major Ross, with
the detachment of the third battalion of the Ninety-fifth
Rifle regiment, was left, while the remainder of the division
was withdrawn, and early the next morning crossed
the Santi Petri river.</p>

<p>The favourable opportunity gained by British valour
was not improved by the Spanish General, who did not
strike a severe blow at the remains of the French army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
retreating in disorder. The inactivity of the Spaniards
continuing, the English army returned to Cadiz.</p>

<p>On the 11th of December, 1811, two companies embarked
at Portsmouth for Spain, and joined the six companies
at Cadiz, in January, 1812.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>In January, 1812, the battalion embarked at Cadiz
for Carthagena, and shortly afterwards proceeded to
Alicant, to join the troops under the command of Major-General
Andrew Ross. On the 21st of August the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>
returned to Carthagena, where they remained
until the 20th of April, 1813, when they again embarked
for Alicant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>On the 31st of May, 1813, the battalion proceeded with
the army, under Lieut.-General Sir John Murray, intended
for the reduction of <em>Tarragona</em>, and on arrival formed part
of the force detached under Lieut.-Colonel Prevost, of
the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>, for the purpose of investing the fort
of <em>San Philippe</em>, in the Col de Balaguer, which blocks
the direct road from Tortosa to Tarragona.</p>

<p>The fort of San Philippe is situated upon the eastern
extremity of an insulated village, in the centre of the
Col de Balaguer, commanding completely the great road
through the pass. It was a square fort with some bastions,
and commanded on two sides by almost inaccessible
mountains.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Prevost and the brigade under his
command, consisting of the second battalion of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>,
the battalion of Roll Dillon, and a detachment
of royal artillery, landed, about eleven o'clock in the
forenoon of the 3rd of June, about one mile to the eastward
of the entrance to the pass from Tarragona, where he was
joined by the Spanish regiments of Barcelona and Palma,
under the command of Don Jose Charles. On the 3rd of
June the fort was invested, and on the day following a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
summons was sent to the commanding officer to surrender,
offering favourable terms, which were, however,
rejected.</p>

<p>On the 5th of June the batteries continued a heavy
fire upon the fort, which was returned by the enemy, who
kept up a heavy and galling fire of shells, round and
grapeshot, during the whole of the night, which occasioned
some loss.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock a most violent storm of thunder
and lightning commenced, which impeded the works
greatly, and as the seamen and troops were quite exhausted,
it became expedient to delay bringing the guns upon the
platforms, and to keep the embrasures masked. In the
evening of the 6th of June a battery of two eight-inch
mortars was placed upon the road, within a few hundred
yards of the Castle, under the breaching battery; one
four-pounder was likewise placed upon the heights to the
right, where the riflemen were stationed.</p>

<p>At daybreak on the 7th, three batteries opened to protect
the working party at the breaching battery, and kept
up a tremendous fire until six o'clock, when that of the
Castle having ceased, their magazines upon the batteries
having been blown up by the shells from the mortars,
the white flag was hoisted upon the Castle, and the
garrison offered to surrender upon conditions of marching
out and grounding their arms upon the glacis, with permission
to carry off the personal baggage, which terms
were granted, as Marshal Suchet's approach was hourly
expected, and Lieutenant-Colonel Prevost would be enabled
to put the fort in a good state of defence. Possession
was taken of the Castle on the 7th of June.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Sir John Murray, in his despatch
to the Marquis of Wellington, stated&mdash;</p>

<p>"This capture, in the present situation of our affairs, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of great importance, as it blocks up the nearest and
most accessible road from Tortosa to Tarragona....</p>

<p>"The troops of both nations bore their fatigue, and
performed their duty with the greatest alacrity and
spirit, and deserve every commendation. Lieutenant-Colonel
Prevost has in a former despatch particularly
noticed the gallantry and good conduct of Ensign
Nelson, of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>, and Ensign John Dermot,
of Roll Dillon's battalion."</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> had two rank and file killed, and
eight rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>Marshal Suchet advancing with an army of superior
numbers, the siege of <em>Tarragona</em>, which had been invested
by Lieutenant-General Sir John Murray on the 3rd of
June, was raised, and on the 12th of that month the troops
embarked for the Col de Balaguer.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Lord William Bentinck assumed
the command of the troops in the East of Spain, in succession
to Lieutenant-General Sir John Murray. His
Lordship joined the army at the Col de Balaguer on the
17th of June, and re-embarked with it for Alicant, at which
place the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> and the rest of the troops
arrived about the 24th of June.</p>

<p>The battle of Vittoria, on the 21st of June, 1813,
gained by the army under the Marquis of Wellington,
changed the aspect of affairs in Spain, and the troops
under Marshal Suchet made some retrograde movements.
The Anglo-Sicilian army, under Lieut.-General Lord
William Bentinck, advancing into Catalonia, proceeded
to invest <em>Tarragona</em>.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July the army, under the command of
Lieutenant-General Lord William Bentinck, marched for
Tarragona. The <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> were employed in the
subsequent operations, and were present at the occupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of Tarragona by the British, which place was blown up by
the French under Marshal Suchet on the night of the
18th of August, after which the enemy retired towards
Barcelona.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Lord William Bentinck continued
in command of this division of the army until the 23rd of
September, 1813, when his Lordship embarked for
Sicily, where fresh changes injurious to the British policy
required his presence, and was succeeded by Lieutenant-General
William Clinton. Previously to his embarkation
his Lordship issued the following General Order, dated
<em>Tarragona</em>, 23rd of September, 1813:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Commander of the Forces deeply laments that
he is compelled to leave the army. It is a pleasing
part of his duty to express his perfect satisfaction with
the subordination and perseverance displayed by the
troops upon all occasions.</p>

<p>"He only regrets that the part assigned to this army
in the plan of the campaign has not permitted the troops
to partake in those brilliant triumphs which would have
been the just recompense of their valour and discipline."</p>

<p>In September the battalion marched into quarters at
Valls, and in October it was removed to Vendrills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>Napoleon's reverses in Germany, and the brilliant successes
of the allied army under the Marquis of Wellington,
had a great effect upon the war in Catalonia,
and the troops under Marshal Suchet withdrew from
several posts. The <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> marched, in February,
1814, to the vicinity of <em>Barcelona</em>, and formed part of
the force employed in the investment of that place.</p>

<p>Hostilities were terminated in April by a treaty of
peace. Napoleon abdicated the throne of France, and the
island of Elba was ceded to him in full sovereignty with
the imperial title for life, and a pension payable from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
revenues of France; and on the 3rd of May, 1814, Louis
XVIII. entered Paris, and ascended the throne of his
ancestors.</p>

<p>Field-Marshal the Marquis of Wellington, in his
despatch dated Toulouse, 19th of April, 1814, alluded
to the conduct of the troops under Lieutenant-General
William Clinton in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upon the breaking up of this army, I perform a
most satisfactory duty in reporting to your Lordship my
sense of the conduct and merit of Lieutenant-General
William Clinton, and of the troops under his command
since they have been employed in the Peninsula. Circumstances
have not enabled those troops to have so brilliant
a share in the operations of the war as their brother-officers
and soldiers on this side of the Peninsula; but
they have not been less usefully employed; their conduct,
when engaged with the enemy, has always been
meritorious; and I have had every reason to be satisfied
with the General Officer commanding, and with them."</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> withdrew from Barcelona, marched
to Tarragona, and embarked at that port on the 24th of
April for Gibraltar, where they arrived on the 4th of May.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>Peace was of short duration. The return of Bonaparte
to France, and his enthusiastic reception at Paris, caused
Louis XVIII. to retire to Ghent. The Allied Powers,
however, refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of
Napoleon, and he was obliged to trust once more to the
chances of war. The campaign was brief; totally
defeated in the celebrated battle of Waterloo, on the
18th of June, 1815, Bonaparte was subsequently compelled
to surrender himself a prisoner to Captain Maitland,
commanding the Bellerophon ship of war; and the
island of St. Helena was afterwards appointed for his
future residence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 6th of April, 1815, the second battalion of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment received the royal authority to
bear on its colours and appointments the word "<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>,"
in commemoration of its services in Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>During this period the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> remained at
Gibraltar, from which station the battalion embarked for
England, on the 25th of March, 1817, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel H. P. Davison, and arrived at
Chatham on the 14th and 15th of May following.</p>

<p>All apprehensions that the peace of Europe would be
disturbed having ceased, the Government decided on
making certain reductions in the army, and the second
battalion of the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment was disbanded
at Canterbury on the 25th of May, 1817.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>


<p class="noindent">The details contained in the foregoing pages show, that
the reputation acquired by the Twentieth Regiment in the
wars during the reigns of King William III. and of Queen
Anne,&mdash;in the defence of Gibraltar in 1727,&mdash;and at the
battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy, has been preserved
unsullied by the <span class="fs70">SECOND BATTALION</span> of that corps since
the year 1758,&mdash;at which period it was constituted the
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment.</p>

<p>In the rocky and almost impregnable position of <em>Belle-Isle</em>
may be traced an analogy between its capture, and
that of <em>Quebec</em>, although in the acquisition of the former
the Nation had not to regret the loss of such a Commander
as <span class="smcap">Major-General James Wolfe</span>, the first Colonel of
the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> regiment, whose death cast a gloom
over the triumphs of the British Arms in the conquest of
Canada.</p>

<p>The <em>Royal Tiger</em>, and the word "<em>India</em>" superscribed,
borne on the regimental colour, record the services of the
<span class="fs70">FIRST BATTALION</span> in the East during a period of twenty-one
years from 1805 to 1826; while the inscriptions of
"<em>Barrosa</em>" and "<em>Peninsula</em>" denote the share taken by
the <span class="fs70">SECOND BATTALION</span> in support of Spanish Independence
from 1810 to 1814.</p>

<p>Services like these, combined <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'with ardous duties'">with arduous duties</ins> in the
Colonies of Great Britain, have acquired for the regiment
the confidence of the Nation and the approbation of the
Sovereign, while its orderly conduct in quarters has
obtained the commendation of the Military Authorities
under whom it has been employed.</p>

<p class="center smcap">James Wolfe.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 21st April, 1758.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">Major-General James Wolfe, son of Lieut.-General
Edward Wolfe, was born at Westerham, in Kent, on the 11th
of January, 1726, and entered the army as a second lieutenant
in Colonel Edward Wolfe's First regiment of Marines, on
the 3rd of November, 1741. On the 27th of March, 1742,
he was removed to the Twelfth foot, in which regiment he
was promoted lieutenant on the 14th of July, 1743. He was appointed
to a company in the Fourth foot on the 23rd of June,
1744, and obtained his majority in the Thirty-third regiment
on the 5th of February, 1747. The war of the <em>Austrian
Succession</em> afforded him many occasions to show the bravery
and decision of his character; and at the battle of <em>Val</em>, or
<em>Laffeld</em>, on the 2nd of July, 1747, when only twenty-one
years of age, his masterly exertions, at a critical juncture,
procured his appointment as a major of brigade, and the
highest encomiums from His Royal Highness the Duke of
Cumberland, then at the head of the army. He was removed
to the Twentieth regiment on the 5th of January, 1749, in
which he was promoted to the rank of lieut.-colonel on the
20th of March, 1750. After the peace he cultivated the arts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of war, and introduced such exactness of discipline into his
corps, that as long as the six British battalions<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> on the plains
of <em>Minden</em> are recorded in the annals of Europe, so long will
Kingsley's (Twentieth) stand amongst the foremost of that
day. He received the brevet rank of colonel on the 21st of
October, 1757, and in January, 1758, was appointed brigadier-general
in America. He was appointed colonel of the
<span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span> on the 21st of April, 1758, on the second
battalion of the Twentieth being constituted the <span class="fs70">SIXTY-SEVENTH</span>
regiment. In July following he distinguished himself
at the capture of the island of <em>Cape Breton</em>. On his
return to England he was appointed to command the important
expedition against <em>Quebec</em>, with the local rank of major-general.
This was an expedition of considerable difficulty
and danger. He was to sail up the St. Lawrence and capture
Quebec, which is situated on its shores. The place was, by
its natural formation, very strong, and succours of all kinds
had been thrown into the town; and the garrison, consisting
of French, Canadians, and Indians, was prepared at all points
for the attack. Major-General Wolfe on landing at the Isle
of Orleans found it necessary to seize and to fortify Point
Levi, and the western parts of the isle, as the Canadians
might otherwise prevent a ship approaching Quebec. These
points having been attained, he ordered works to be constructed
there for the bombardment of the town. The French
endeavoured to prevent the construction of these works, and
crossed the river for that purpose, but in vain. Finding,
however, that an attack on the city from the river side would
be of small effect, Major-General Wolfe resolved to carry on
the attack on the land side. To effect this, he first attempted
to land his troops some miles below the town near the falls of
Montmorenci; here he was repulsed by a large division of
the French forces, with loss. Undismayed by his repulse
near the falls of Montmorenci, on the 31st of July, 1759, he
saw, in this reverse, the necessity of greater efforts, and conceived
the bold design of drawing the French from their unassailable
position by scaling the heights of Abraham. The
soldiers clambered up the heights with great difficulty, and
the guns were hauled up by means of ropes and pulleys fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
round the trees, which covered the banks from top to bottom.
At the top the plain commences, and extends close under the
walls of the city. By this arrangement he forced the French
to come out of the city. The Marquis de Montcalm was
thus compelled to abandon his camp, and risk a battle for the
protection of Quebec. While bravely animating his troops
on the 13th of September, 1759, and at the moment when
victory was almost within his grasp, he received a wound in
the wrist, and another in the breast, which rendered it necessary
to bear him to the rear. There, roused from fainting,
in the agonies of death, by the cry of "They run! they run!"
he eagerly, asked "Who run?" and being told the French,
and that they were defeated, he exclaimed, "Then I thank
God, and die contented;" and almost immediately expired.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
He was in the thirty-fourth year of his age. Brigadier-Generals
Monckton and Townshend, after the loss of their commander,
completed the victory. On the 18th of September
Quebec surrendered; and, like Gibraltar, conquered by a
similar bold exploit, has, to the present time, continued an
appendage to the crown of Great Britain. The remains of
Major-General Wolfe were conveyed to Portsmouth, and at
night on the 20th of November were deposited in the family
vault at Greenwich. A handsome monument was also erected,
by order of Government, to his memory in Westminster
Abbey. The Major-General is represented as endeavouring
to close, with his hand, the wound made in his breast, and is
supported by a grenadier. An angel is seen in the clouds,
holding a wreath ready to crown the expiring hero. On
the pyramid is represented, in relief, the faithful Highland
serjeant who attended him; and his sorrow at witnessing
the agonies of his dying master is so pathetically expressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that a spectator can scarcely view the sculpture unmoved.
In the front, in alto-relief, is depicted the landing at Quebec,
with a view of the precipices the troops had to ascend before the
enemy could be attacked. The inscription is as follows:&mdash;<br />
"<em>To the memory of James Wolfe, Major-General and
Commander-in-Chief of the British Land Forces on an
expedition against Quebec, who, after surmounting, by
ability and valour, all obstacles of art and nature, was
slain in the moment of victory, on the 13th of September,
1759, the King and the Parliament of Great Britain dedicate
this monument.</em>"</p>

the decease of General Peter Craig. His Majesty King George
IV. removed General the Right Honorable Sir William
Keppel to the colonelcy of the Second, or Queen's Royal
regiment, in the year 1828, on the decease of Major-General
Sir Henry Torrens. In 1813 Sir William Keppel was
raised to the rank of general in the army; and was for
many years Groom of the Bedchamber and Equerry to His
Majesty King George IV., who bestowed on him the appointment
of Governor of Guernsey, when it became vacant by
the death of the Earl of Pembroke, in 1827. The Right
Honorable General Sir William Keppel, G.C.B., died at
Paris, on the 11th of December, 1834.</p>

picture, and represents the moment when news is brought that the victory
is in favour of the English. This picture attracted extraordinary
notice, not only for the event it represents, but also for its general excellence,
and from the circumstance of the characters being dressed in appropriate
costume, and not habited as Greeks or Romans, which was
considered the classic dress in historical pictures of this period. It is
one of the best of our historical pictures, and the painter has happily and
poetically introduced the Indian warrior, who is watching the dying
hero, to see if he equalled in fortitude the warriors of his own savage
race.</p></div></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
